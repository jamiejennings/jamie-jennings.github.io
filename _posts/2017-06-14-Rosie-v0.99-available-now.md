We are hard at work on Rosie v1.0.0, which is roughly *2x faster* than the
already-fast v0.99k.  And there are new features that we will be announcing in
the coming weeks.

Note:  Rosie is *not* an IBM product, and statements about Rosie (including
about future releases) are the personal statements of Rosie's inventor.

That said, we are targeting August 2017 for the release of Rosie v1.0.0.

Rosie now has its own [website](http://rosie-lang.org), which will be a
repository of documentation, examples, and news.

The current version is [Rosie
v0.99k](http://github.com/jamiejennings/rosie-pattern-language).

announcements.
